                Hi. I'm Esmeralda Quezada, nice to meet you. Please take a peak around see if you like my work.

                I'm a recent web developer in training by The Knowledge house as a fellow in the full stack web developer cohort. I stumbled upon the tkh in a previous internship in technology as I was exploring a career change into technology and was trying to learn more of technology and its many career opportunities. At first I was going for a different cohort in tkh and I can say Im beyond grateful I did not end up in that cohort as I enjoy web development more than the career paths I had tried before. In web development I have gone from 0 knowledge to now being able to know and understand HTML, CSS, java-script, node.js, React and having some projects under my belt and Iâ€™m very grateful to tkh for that.
